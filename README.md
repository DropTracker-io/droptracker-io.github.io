# DropTracker GitHub Pages
This GitHub repository contains various content used for players on the RuneLite client.

It is regularly updated by an automated background process to ensure an accurate, working listing of webhook URLs are made available to client users at all times.

The code that handles this automated update process can be [found in this repository](https://github.com/droptracker-io/droptracker-internal).
